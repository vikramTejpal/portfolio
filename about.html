                        <h1>Hi, Thanks for visiting my site</h1>
                        <p>Hey, my name is Vikram Sharma, i am a software developer. I design, build immersive and beautiful web applications through carefully crafted code and user-centric design.
                            <br>
                            I am naturally curious, a problem solver, and a continous learner. My dream is travelling the world learning different cultures, while also coding and building applications that help people solve their problems.
                            <br>
                            Recently, I became so interested in ethical hacking and CyberSecurity that I plan to pursue a Master's degree in CyberSecurity from Deakin University with a focus on securing web applications.
                            <br>
                            So are you looking for a hard-working, communicative and caring developer? I am super excited to work on ambitious projects with positive people.
                        </p>
